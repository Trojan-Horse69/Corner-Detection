This repository contains a corner detection algorithm and the image used to test it.

Contained in the ipynb file are two algorithms: One algorithm is to test an input image and thhe other is for Real time corner detection.

The Real time corner detection algorithm contains a trackbar that allows for the control of the quality of the corners detected.
